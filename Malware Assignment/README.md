# Malware and Viruses Assignment

<b> Assignment 1</b>

Taking cues from the code given for AbraWorm.py, turn the FooVirus virus into a worm by incorporating networking code in it. The resulting worm will still infect only the ‘.foo’ files, but it will also have the ability to hop into other machines.



<b> Assignment 2</b>

Modify the code AbraWorm.py code given so that no two copies of the worm are exactly the same in all of the infected hosts at any given time. One way to accomplish this would be by inserting worm alteration code after the comment line 

``` 
# Finally, deposit a copy of AbraWorm.pl at the target host: 
```

that you see near the end of the main infinite loop in the script. This additional code in the worm could insert some extra newline characters between a randomly chosen set of lines, some extra randomly selected characters in the comment blocks, some extra white space between the identifiers in each statement at randomly chosen places, and so on.
